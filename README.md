# exafmm-t 

This is modified version of the ExaFMM-t project. 

The following changes from the original are made:
* Fixed compiler errors on Windows
  * Simplified OpenMP implementation where not supported by MSVC
  * CMakeLists.txt modified. Now builds with VCPGK.
  * SSE implementation updated.
* Removed Linux-specific libraries
  * std::chrono is now used for timing
  * docopt is now used

**exafmm-t** is a kernel-independent fast multipole method library for solving N-body problems.
It provides both C++ and Python APIs.
We use [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) to create Python bindings from C++ code.
exafmm-t aims to deliver compelling performance with a simple code design and a user-friendly interface.
It currently supports both potential and force calculation of Laplace, low-frequency Helmholtz and modified Helmholtz (Yukawa) kernel in 3D.
In addition, users can easily add other non-oscillatory kernels under exafmm-t's framework.
